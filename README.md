Cloud Data Privacy & Security Highlights:

> Security OF the Cloud does not equal Security IN the Cloud.
> Need to manage & maintain Data Lifecycle with Security in Mind.
> Leverage Cryptography, Service Configurations and access to Control to secure data in Transit, at Rest, in Use. 
> Think Defence in Depth with Controls in Layers (not in Parallel).
> Stick to the Least Privillege Principle when thinking IAM and Networking in both design and operations.
> Think Identity, Authentication, Authorization, Audit for ANY thing in the Cloud or out of the Cloud.
